# Drop-Vaporization-Prediction-Model
This Repository contains an analytical model to predict the amount of vapor generated by an impinging drop on superheated superhydrophobic (SH) surfaces. The model accounts for drop impact $We$ number, surface temperature, and SH surface geometry. The model is capable of handling microscale SH surfaces with rib or post geometry. A temperature jump length is computed using surface dimensions for both types of surface geometry. This temperature jump length is used to characterize each surface with one parameter. Model results are compared to experimental results of thermal atomization of impinging drops.
